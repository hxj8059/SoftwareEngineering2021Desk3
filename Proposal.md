# **WildGuard**

In the course of human society, many fauna are on the brink of extinction every day due to natural or man-made factors. In the wild environment, people even hunters do not know which species are endangered and therefore unintentionally harm them. In order to protect endangered and vulnerable fauna from unintentional killing by humans, we need to find a way to aware people about these. A website could display the fauna information and it serve as a reminder to hunters and anyone else.

We are planning to design a visualized 3D Earth as a display platform. After classification, we would put information about endangered and vulnerable fauna on the dynamic earth. Information such as picture, detailed introduction, distribution and endangered situation of each animal above would be considered. One can then find out where they are and how many EN and VN animals are around them by rotating the earth model. Clicking on the corresponding area will display a picture and a text description in the air. In addition, we will include some special hints for identifying them so that people will know them immediately when they encounter them.

Our website stands out from other information websites since 3D Earth user-interface is interesting and catches the eye. People especially hunters could travel around the world in few minutes and get to know about the EN and VN fauna at the same time. It could leave a vivid impression on their brains and thus avoid some unnecessary harm to fauna. The scope is EN and VN fauna worldwide. To achieve this, gathering enough information and building a 3D Earth could be a challenge for us. Therefore, an external API would definitely be helpful. As for the presentation platform, we would like to go with a desktop for now, but a mobile app would be an upgrade option if there is enough time.

Our goal is harmony between human and nature.
